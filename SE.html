            <p class="paragraph">  I developed this simple mobile app in 2021 for my AP CSP end-of-year project on MIT App Inventor - one
                of my first attempts at developing. First, the user must choose a base color, then a central graphic for their personalized image, 
                then may choose to draw over it for further customization (input). The user gets a customized graphic as a result (output). The user may then share the final product through text or may save it
                to their camera roll. In addition to coding with block code (javascript), the available graphics and background colors were all created by me in Adobe Illustrator. 
                Additionally, icons such as arrows and cursive-fancy-looking text were created in Illustrator. Overall, while not perfect, I had so 
                much fun creating this small app - it taught me a lot about the process of developing an application where 
                you must account for the graphics, certain aspects of UX/UI, testing how the product looks/ works on different screens, and of course the code behind it. The image below is my first attempt at 
                a sort of wireframe - lots to learn since then!

                For this Data Structures project, a data set is provided from the New York State Open Data collection: New York State Registered Tax Return Preparers and Facilitators, and 
                allows users to interact with the data set. The program takes in a CSV text file with the data (some information in the file being invalid or missing accounted for) and uses the several classes
                created within the program to store the data of each row of the table in the CSV file with: name (first, middle ,last), location (city, state, country and zip code) & more. The user inputs what information
                they'd like to retrieve from the file using keywords and a list of results are computed/displayed as the output. <br> <br> I had to create a NAME class which stored information about first name, last name, and the middle initial (accounting
                for empty strings/null), create 3 constructors with the different ways names could be stored, have an equals method to check if the person's first name, last name and middle initial were the same, and implement a comparable interface 
                to compare name objects by last, first, and middle initial. Next, I created a LOCATION taking in city, state, country and zip code as parameters. In the constructor 
                for this class, I made sure to account for null state, country, and zip codes(if a zip value was 4 digits then the leading digit should be assumed to be zero), and invlaid zip values (non-digit chars). I created an equals method
                and Comparable interface for this class comparing by the zip code, city name, then the state, then country (if one was null I'd compare with the next one). I created a RECORD class to store information about a particular record/row from the input file (name, business associated with record), 
                and location. This class provided getters and setters for NAME, business, and LOCATION, an equals method, a Comparable Record interface where the comparison should be done by the persons' names as the primary key, and by the location as the secondary key, and a toString method
                printing out these three pieces of information in a specific way. A RECORDLIST class was made to store all these unique RECORDS, inheriting from ArrayList RECORD. Here the methods included a getByName method which returns a list of records for which the keyword parameter is a substring of person's last name or first name, 
                a getByCity method which returns a list of records for whcih the keyword is a substring of the city at which the tax preparer is located, and a getByZip method which returns a list of records for which the zip-code (if specified) matches the zip argument exactly. In all these methods, 
                null arguments are accounted for with exception handling. I was able to use a NYS_Taxes class created by my instructor and parses the data from the input file, constructs the RecordList object and provides the user interaction, along with the CSV-parsing file provided 
                to make the program work together as a whole.

            <p class="paragraph"> In 2020 I took a semester course in Python for the first time. This project, created in 
                Pycharm, was a presentation of the skills I'd learned from the course. The program takes in a paragraph in English (input) and 
                returns a revised version of the text which substitutes words for what the program identifies as "weak" language 
                with a stronger word choice. It displays the calculated percentage of words that are repetitive too (output). 
                I found commonly used "weak" words and stored them in a 2D array, as well as commonly repetitive words such as "like" in 
                another. Since the sentence/paragraph is scanned for these words stored in the arrays, there is a possiblity that 
                the program may not catch other repetitive or weak words. If I were to revisit this project, I would 
                try to apply the correct data structures/research of patterns in language to make the program as efficient as possible.
